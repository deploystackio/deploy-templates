# DeployStack Helm Chart Repository

This repository hosts the [Helm](https://helm.sh) packages generated by [DeployStack](https://deploystack.io). These charts are automatically created from Docker configurations (docker-compose files and docker run commands) using the [docker-to-iac](https://github.com/deploystackio/docker-to-iac) module.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**Do not manually edit files in this branch (gh-pages).** This branch is automatically generated and maintained by GitHub Actions. Any manual changes will be overwritten.

## Using the Helm Repository

Add the DeployStack Helm repository to your local Helm configuration:

```bash
helm repo add deploystackio https://deploystackio.github.io/deploy-templates/
helm repo update
```

### Installing Charts

Once you've added the repository, you can install any of the available charts:

```bash
# List available charts
helm search repo deploystackio

# Install a specific chart
helm install my-release deploystackio/chart-name
```
